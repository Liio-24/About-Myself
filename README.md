# About-Myself

My name is Lisa Ifechi George. I am 20+ years. I am from Ihiala LGA in Anambra state. I am currently rounding my 5th year in medical school, although that isn't entirely true, because this is my 8th year in school since 2015. I see my years passing by, but at least I am still alive. The Nigerian Medical School system won't be the end of me. Haha.

That will be all for now.

## More detailS 

I am transiting into tech. I have gotten a lot stares as to why I should be doing this, when i'm already a medical student. I mean, isn't medicine stressful enough. Well, medicine is oo. That is why I will always appreciate bootcamps that are flexible and give room for other things to be done. Back to matter. I believe the tech space isn't only for people who do certain courses. Everybody is busy in one way, or another. Knowing how much you can take at a time, and knowing how to manage your time is what matters. The mistake I would say I made, was trying to run how many programs at the same time. I ended up feeling overwhelmed, and even though I met deadlines, I was beyond stressed. 

So my advice to people like me:
- find a niche that you are comfortable in. Don't choose just because they said there is money in that area.
- Don't take multiple trainings because it's free. Take one at a time. That way, you can get the most out of it, and conserve your resources too.

That will be all for now.
