# About-Myself

My name is Lisa Ifechi George. I am 20+ years. I am from Ihiala LGA in Anambra state. I am currently rounding my 5th year in medical school, although that isn't entirely true, because this is my 8th year in school since 2015. I see my years passing by, but at least I am still alive. The Nigerian Medical School system won't be the end of me. Haha.

That will be all for now.
